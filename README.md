# Code Review (part 2)

## Challenge

### Step 1: Setup

- Use the template to create a new repo
- clone your repo
- run `yarn` or `npm install`
- run `yarn start` or `npm start`

### Step 2: Build a feature

- create a new branch (with a proper name!)
- check as many "todos" as possible
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m"<meaningful message here>"`
- `git push -u origin <branch name`
- In github you should see the branch name

### Step 3: Create new PR

- go to the repo
- if you pushed your branch successfully, you should see "open a new PR" button on the main page of the repo
- if you don't see it, got to "pull requests" tab and press on the "new pull request" green button
- create a new pull request

### Step 4: fill in all details

- meaningful title
- add a full description (overview, changelog, resources)
- assignee
- reviewers
- labels (optional)

### Step 5: add collaborator

- go to settings
- collaborators (on the side navbar)
- add collaborator by email or user name

### Step 6: Review!

- review your peer's PR
- add comments on specific lines
- add general comments regarding the details of the PR
